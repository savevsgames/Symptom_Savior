# Symptom Savior API Integration Fixes

## Current State Analysis

### Application Architecture

The Symptom Savior application is a React Native (Expo) mobile app with a Node.js/Express backend. The app allows users to:

1. Track symptoms and health data
2. Interact with an AI assistant for medical guidance
3. Manage personal health profiles
4. View health trends and insights

The AI functionality is powered by TxAgent, a specialized medical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that provides evidence-based health information.


## FILES TO HELP BUILD

- There is a file for you to use as an external memory. Use it as a previous, current and next task manager and a memory bank - Docs/Memory.md
- There is a file with the database schema and migration context - Socs/Supabase_Config.md 
- Log changes to the changelog file - Docs/Changelog.md 
- Create API documentation to - Docs/API_Documentation.md
- Write any enhancements outside of the scope of the plan to Docs/Enhancements.md
- A file - Docs/Marketing.md will be used to create a marketing plan for the application when we complete it. Any notes that you have on marketing can be placed there when a relevant idea comes to mind.
