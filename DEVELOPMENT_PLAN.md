## Technical Priorities

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix Data Flow** (Day 1-2)
   ```typescript
   // Update useSymptoms hook to use real Supabase
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('documents')
     .select('*')
     .eq('user_id', user.id)
     .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
   ```

2. **Implement RLS Policies** (Day 2-3)
   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS on documents table
   ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   -- Policy for users to access their own data
   CREATE POLICY "Users can access own documents" ON documents
   FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

3. **Complete AI Integration** (Day 4-7)
   - Set up TxAgent API endpoints
   - Implement conversation persistence
   - Add medical safety checks

### Architecture Improvements

1. **State Management**
   - Implement React Query for server state
   - Add optimistic updates for better UX
   - Cache frequently accessed data

2. **Error Handling**
   - Global error boundary
   - Retry mechanisms for failed requests
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for heavy components
   - Image optimization
   - Bundle size optimization

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- [ ] Daily active users tracking
- [ ] Symptom logging frequency
- [ ] AI assistant usage rates
- [ ] Feature adoption metrics

### Technical Health
- [ ] App crash rate < 1%
- [ ] API response time < 500ms
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] User satisfaction scores

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **AI Response Quality**: Add fallback responses and human review system
- **Data Privacy**: Regular security audits and compliance checks

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity**: Gradual feature rollout with user feedback
- **Medical Accuracy**: Clear disclaimers and professional review
- **Accessibility**: Regular accessibility testing and improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Focus on database integration and core symptom management
2. **Week 2**: Complete user profile system and basic AI integration
3. **Week 3**: Advanced AI features and voice integration
4. **Week 4**: Analytics and emergency detection
5. **Week 5-6**: Polish, testing, and optimization
6. **Week 7-8**: Production preparation and launch

This plan prioritizes core functionality first, then builds advanced features on a solid foundation. Each phase includes testing and user feedback integration to ensure we're building the right features effectively.
